    6. [xx] FAQ section "expand/collapse" icons look too big. Make them smaller.
    9. [xx] Standardize all UI elements. For example: FAQ section and Job Openings section should look similar.
    10. [] Turn subscribe button background to green after subscribe animation.
    12. [xx] Book a demo form should fit in single page without scrolling on laptop. It is ok to scroll on phone.
        -> To make this competible for all size of screens, its time consuming
        -> for now i resize the demo form for laptop size screens: that fullfill this condition
    23. [xx] Stacked card animation does not work for mobile. Please make it work similarly.
        -> not add animaion on mobile but make it responsive for all devices (tabs, pc, mobile)
    24. [ ] Remove "Learn More" button below stacked cards in all devices.
    25. [ ] Testimonials - make cards centered on all screens.
    26. [ ] Standardize alert message for all form submissions. Including placement on screen.
    27. [ ] Add TOC of Cookies as sent before.

1. [ ] At startup, latency issues that cause text to appear default font, and time for all the GIFs/videos to appear. Make default text "Sans Serif" instead of "Serif".
3. [xx] Homepage Section 2 animation is still missing. Please add.
4. [xx] Homepage "From Our Community" Section, I want to see 3rd card in the background. Currently it just appears suddenly when you press the button on the right.
14. [xx] Contact us form currently lets you submit without checking the "I agree..." checkbox. Make the checkbox mandatory.
13. [xx] Submitting book a demo form should collapse the form and only show "thank you for submitting, we will get back to you shortly" message.
15. [xx] On footer, remove "Community" link. We do not have that working right now.
18. [xx] Arvinder to work on Terms of Use and Privacy Policy page.
21. [xx] Stacked card animation: Cards that are already placed on screen should not be rotating. Please keep them static.
20. [ ] Lots of improvement can be made on the code. Please standardize file naming system, folder structures, variable names, function names, commenting, linting.
