# task
[x] Testimonials - make cards centered on all screens.
[x] Start project with draftflow form at footer, convert this to a subscribe form with subscribe alert message.
[x] Turn subscribe button background to green after subscribe animation.
[x] Standardize alert message for all form submissions. Including placement on screen.
[x] Add TOC of Cookies as sent before.

# Enhancement Tasks
[x] Homepage Section 2 animation need to be improved.
[ ] At startup, latency issues that cause text to appear default font, and time for all the GIFs/videos to appear. Make default text "Sans Serif" instead of "Serif".
[ ] Lots of improvement can be made on the code. Please standardize file naming system, folder structures, variable names, function names, commenting, linting.

# temporary solution
[x] Remove cookies dialog box for now.
