# fscoreai-site

## Setup
- Run `npm install` to install all essential packages.
- Run `npm run dev` to run the project locally.

## Progress
- The home page, header/nav bar, and footer are almost ready but need some design changes.
- The blog page is ready.
- Markdown files are embedded to display blog post content. This allows admins to add their content in markdown files, which will be statically generated into HTML code when the project is built.
  - Note: The markdown file is only set for description, not for all content. Title, date, and thumbnail will be added in JSON format.
